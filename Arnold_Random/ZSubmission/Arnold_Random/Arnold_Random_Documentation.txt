Above and Beyond Features:

- I put in some scripts that allow the player to emit flames and damage all of the skeletons

- The flamethrower triggers an onFire script that sets the skeletons on fire. After a period of time, the fire will go out. While skeletons are on fire, they are being damaged.

- After the skeletons reach 0 health, they are destroyed.

- I spawn crates, barrels, trees, and rocks randomly across the terrain.
	Crates and barrels have rigid bodies.

- I had trouble with the flame thrower. The flamethrower wouldn't work unless the particle system was local, which means it is more like a beam of fire.
	You can't create a curving flame by moving the camera like I originally could.
